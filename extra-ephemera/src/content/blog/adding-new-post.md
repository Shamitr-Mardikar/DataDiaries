I talk about why I want to start blogging. What prompted me to start this one night out of the blue and what my journey has been till today.

## Why Start?

> If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.

While doomscrolling last night my phone died, and while I struggled to find a charger, I thought I could take a break. I kept my phone on the bedside and sat there. Staring at a wall. A wall
with photos from my childhood. Memories I'd made with my friends, my pet dog and my family. All those pictures were old, mostly before 2019. It'd been 5 years but I had no recollection of what I was then or what I had become now.

In the midst of all the garbage I found a clip of someone quoting confuscius where they mentioned "You have two lives. The second begins when you realise you only have one." As I sat on the couch and pondered over what I'd watched I figured unless I start documenting, writing and puting out my thoughts somewhere. All this time would slip away, these moments from my grasp like sand. The harder I'd try to hold onto them and the more I'd try to remember the more I'd forget.

This blog whatever or however you want to see it is so that If I see myself sitting in the darkness again five years down the line. I have something to look back on to understand how I looked at the world, why I looked at it that way and the memories I made along the way, because at the end of the day, it's about the journey. Not the destination.
